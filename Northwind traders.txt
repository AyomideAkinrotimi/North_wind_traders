Project Title: Northwind traders

Project Description:
In this project, I will use my advanced Excel and Power BI skills to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a trading-related dataset. This dataset includes specific information on products, product categories, customers, staff, order details, and shipping information. My goal is to filter, analyze, and visualize the data to address and answer real-world business concerns.

Methodology:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Data Validation: I ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data by identifying and correcting errors or anomalies.

Missing Values Handling: I address missing data through imputation or removal, ensuring dataset completeness.

Normalization: I standardize data formats and units for consistency across different datasets.


Data Filtering and Transformation:

Segmentation: I filter data based on specific criteria such as time periods and customer segments.

Aggregation: I summarize data to derive meaningful columns, such as total revenue by multiplying the unit price by quantity sold. I also create a column in Excel to calculate the difference in days from the order date to the shipping date to get the average shipping duration.


Analysis in Excel:

Pivot Tables and Charts: I utilize pivot tables to dynamically explore relationships between different data dimensions and create visualizations to identify trends and patterns.

Sorting: I organize data in a specific order in the pivot table by ascending (A-Z, smallest to largest) and descending (Z-A, largest to smallest).


Advanced Visualization in Power BI:

Interactive Dashboards: I develop interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.

Advanced Analytics: I apply advanced analytics features such as DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to perform sophisticated calculations and derive deeper insights such as creating a custom column to extract the years of product sale so i can show the trend of sales over the years . i achieved that by writing  =Date.ToText([orderdate], "yyyy")


Insights and Business Implications:

Product Performance: I analyze product sales and profitability across different categories to identify top-performing and underperforming products.
Customer Behavior: I investigate customer purchasing patterns, segmenting customers based on behavior and value to the business.
Employee Contribution: I evaluate employee performance metrics to understand their impact on sales and identify high-performing individuals or teams.
Order and Shipping Efficiency: I assess order processing times and shipping efficiencies, identifying bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.

                         Questions Solved in Excel
---Calculate the Total Sales (Revenue) for Each Category of Products:
Achieved by multiplying the unit price by quantity.

---Determine Which Customer Has Placed the Highest Number of Orders:
Utilized a pivot table to display customer IDs and the count of orders.
Created a bar chart with customer IDs on the x-axis and the total number of orders on the y-axis.

---Calculate the Total Sales Generated by Each Employee:
Used a pivot table to show employee IDs and the count of orders.
Created a bar chart with employee IDs on the x-axis and the count of sales on the y-axis.

---Show the Trend in Sales Over Time:
Plotted a line chart using the order date column to display the trend in sales over time.

---Calculate the Average Time it Takes to Process an Order from the Order Date to the Shipped Date:
Calculated the difference in days between the order date and the shipping date.
Used the average function to determine the average processing time.

                        Questions Solved in Power BI
---Build a Top-Level KPI Dashboard for the Executive Team to Show the Sales Trend:
Transformed the data by creating a custom column for the year of the order date using the function: =Date.ToText([orderdate], "yyyy").
Used a line chart to display the sales trend over the years.

---Build a Top-Level KPI Dashboard for the Executive Team to Show Product Performance:
Created a matrix showing the product ID, product name, and the sum of revenue.

---Build a Top-Level KPI Dashboard for the Executive Team to Show Key Customers:
Created a matrix showing the customer ID, customer name, and the sum of revenue.

---Build a Top-Level KPI Dashboard for the Executive Team to Show Shipping Cost:
Used a funnel chart to display the shipping cost by each shipping company.

---Build a Top-Level KPI Dashboard for the Executive Team to Show Employee Performance:
Created a bar chart with employee IDs and names on the x-axis and the sum of revenue on the y-axis.
